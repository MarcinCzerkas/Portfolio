# 👋 Hi, I'm Marcin Czerkas

I’m a **data enthusiast** passionate about turning raw information into clear insights and practical solutions.
I enjoy exploring datasets, building dashboards, automating processes, and applying analytical thinking to real business challenges.

💼 Currently, I’m transitioning my career toward **Data Analytics / Business Intelligence / Business Analytics**, combining my background in the business (risk department) and project management with new technical skills in data.

I work as a **Quantitative Expert** in the Risk Department at a car leasing company. My role is all about protecting the business — I analyze data to spot early warning signs and turn insights into actions that prevent losses.

I speak fluently in **5 languages**: Polish, English, German, Italian and Spanish.
